Hi! I am Praneeth and welcome to my *(still very nascent)* blog! I am a fourth semester PhD student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/). I work under the guidance of [Namrata Vaswani](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/). Broadly speaking, my interests are in the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistical Signal Processing. Particularly I work on online, or streaming algorithms for matrix factorization.

I obtained my Bachelor of Technology degree from the [Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department](http://www.eee.nitk.ac.in/) at [National Institute of Technology Surathkal](http://www.nitk.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Gururaj S Punekar](http://www.eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/GSP). My undergraduate thesis was on application of Genetic Algorithms to estimate the parameters of several classes of Lightning Strokes.

After undergrad studies, I was a Project Associate at the Indian Institue of Science, under [Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/). I was part of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) consortium which aimed at developing TTS systems for Indian Languages. Specifically I worked on (a) Enhancing the naturalness of speech synthesized from the Hidden Markov Model based framework, and (b) efficient algorithms to resample speech.

In my spare time I enjoy playing [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis)!
