Hi! I am Praneeth, and welcome to my *(still very nascent)* blog! I am a fourth semester PhD student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/). I work under the guidance of [Namrata Vaswani](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/). Broadly speaking, my interests are in the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistical Signal Processing. Particularly I work on online, or streaming algorithms for matrix factorization.

I am the *web co-ordinator* of the [ISU Data Science Reading Group](http://www.dsrg.stuorg.iastate.edu/), where we meet regularly to brainstorm about cool ideas in Machine Learning. In semester breaks, we participate [here](https://virajshah018.github.io/)

I obtained my Bachelor of Technology degree from the [Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department](http://www.eee.nitk.ac.in/) at [National Institute of Technology Surathkal](http://www.nitk.ac.in/). For my [thesis](/Btechpaper.pdf), I worked on efficient estimatation of standard parameters of Lightning Strokes through Genetic Algorithms, under the guidance of [Gururaj S Punekar](http://www.eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/GSP).

Following completion of B.Tech, I was a Project Associate at the Indian Institue of Science, under [Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/). Here, I was part of the [Text-to-Speech (TTS) consortium](https://www.iitm.ac.in/donlab/tts/) which aimed at developing TTS systems for Indian Languages. Specifically I worked on (a) enhancing the naturalness of speech synthesized from the Hidden-Markov-Model framework, and (b) efficient algorithms to resample or compress speech.

In my spare time I enjoy playing [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis)!
