This page aims to provide a mild explanation of the projects that I have worked on during my PhD. The links to actual pre-prints/papers can be found [here](https://praneethmurthy.github.io/publications). 

* [Finite Sample Guarantees for PCA under generic noise models.](PCALimits.html)

* [Algorithms for provably solving the dynamic robust PCA problem.](DynRPCA.html)

* [Algorithms for provably solving the dynamic compressive robust PCA problem.](CompDynRPCA.html)
