Just checking whether this thing works or not. 

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$



In this age of big data, the focus on most of the learning algorithms is to be able to process data quickly. While working with data, a researcher has three options, work in the same dimension, lift the dimensions into a higher dimensions, or to reduce the dimension.  $$\|P\| = 1$$.
