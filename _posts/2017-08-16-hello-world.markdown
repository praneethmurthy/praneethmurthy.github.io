Hello everyone. Welcome to YAMLB!! In this series of (very) ambitious blog posts, I intend to put forth my take on the theoretical, and algorithmic aspects of Machine Learning. According to the *Economist.com*, [Data is the new oil](https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/07/data-new-oil-digital-economy/). Although I am not entirely convinced of the validiy of the metaphor, what is true is that the utility of Data, and hence Data Science, has experienced an unprecedented growth in the last two decades. Scientists from various backgrounds are coming together in collecting, cleaning, and making sense of data. All these broadly fall under the purview of *Big Data* or *Machine Learning* if you will. As of the current post date, I will mainly focus on the last task, i.e., making sense of data. 

I hope that this blog helps someone (myslef included!) find answers or maybe even better, a question or two worth pondering over.
