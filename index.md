Hi! I am Praneeth, and I am a fifth year Ph.D. student at [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/) where I work with [Prof. Namrata Vaswani](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/). Broadly speaking, my interests are in the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistical Signal Processing. Specifically, I work on online algorithms for matrix factorization problems. In the past I have interned at SRI-International (formerly Stanford Research Institute) where I was mentored by [Dr. Yi Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iD6QaXcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Ajay Divakaran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=N-i5QKIAAAAJ). Here, I worked on Gaussian Process-based methods for spatio-temporal time-series forecasting.

Much before that, I recieved my Bachelor of Technology degree from National Institute of Technology Surathkal where I [worked](/BtechPaper.pdf) on efficient estimation of standard parameters of Lightning Strokes through Genetic Algorithms, and was advised by [Prof. Gururaj S Punekar](http://www.eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/GSP). I was also a Research Associate at the Indian Institue of Science, and worked with [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/) on Text-to-Speech synthesis systems for Indian Languages. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis)!
