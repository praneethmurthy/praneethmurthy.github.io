Hi! I am Praneeth, and welcome to my *(still very nascent)* blog! I am a PhD candidate in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/). I work with [Namrata Vaswani](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/). Broadly speaking, my interests are in the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistical Signal Processing. Particularly I work on online algorithms for matrix factorization.

I obtained my Bachelor of Technology degree from [National Institute of Technology Surathkal](http://www.nitk.ac.in/). For my [thesis](/BtechPaper.pdf), I worked on efficient estimation of standard parameters of Lightning Strokes through Genetic Algorithms, advised by [Gururaj S Punekar](http://www.eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/GSP). After completing my Bachelors' degree, I was a Research Associate at the Indian Institue of Science, under [Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/) where I worked on Text-to-Speech synthesis systems for Indian Languages. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis)!
