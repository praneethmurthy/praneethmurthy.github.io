I am a Vertex Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of Southern California](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu) working with [Prof. Urbashi Mitra](https://ee.usc.edu/~ubli/ubli.html). Broadly speaking, my interests are in the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistical Signal Processing. I got my Ph.D. from  [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Namrata Vaswani](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/). My [thesis](/thesis.pdf) was titled "Provable and Efficient Algorithms for Robust Subspace Learning and Tracking".  Much before that, I recieved my Bachelor of Technology degree from National Institute of Technology Surathkal where I worked on efficient estimation of standard parameters of Lightning Strokes through Genetic Algorithms, and was advised by [Prof. Gururaj S Punekar](http://www.eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/GSP). I was also a Research Associate at the Indian Institue of Science, and worked with [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/) on Text-to-Speech synthesis systems for Indian Languages. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis)!
