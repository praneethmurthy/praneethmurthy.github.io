The problem we study here is a natural extension of two problems, (i) Subspace Tracking and (ii) Robust PCA. Both these problems are well studied and there exists a vast body of literature that analyze the statistical and algorithmic aspects of this problem. In this work, we build upon the ReProCS framework to show that under very mild conditions we are able to provably solve the dynamic RPCA problem.
