The problem we study here is a natural extension of the [dynamic robust PCA](DynRPCA.html) problem, where the measurements are compressive measurement of the data matrix. The goal here is to track the sparse outliers with time and update-and estimate the ``low dimensional subspace''. A common application where the above model makes sense is in Dynamic functional MRI.
